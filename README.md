# vagrant-build-riak
A script-supported Vagrantfile, to work with [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) that builds [Riak KV](http://basho.com/riak/) from source.

## About this 
This project goes through the effort of downloading and building Riak from source, including its pre-requisites. This is **not** designed to be a quick provisioning effort. There are other Vagrantfiles in Basho Labs that provision from [Packagecloud.io](packagecloud.io/basho/riak), which will be much faster. This process is all about learning.


By default, upon `vagrant up`, you have: 
* A `1` Riak node running on one VM
* HTTP interface available on `http://localhost:27018`
* Protobuff interface available on `http://localhost:27017`
* It will take around 10 minutes to provision

These parameters are all customizeable within the `Vagrantfile` provided. 

## Getting Started

Simple clone this repo, `cd` in and `vagrant up`.

## How it works

TODO


### What to do next

* `vagrant ssh` in and familiar yourself with the `riak` and `riak-admin` commands
* `vagrant ssh` in and play around


### What if I mess up?

The beauty of Vagrant is that re-building is simple. At the command line of your host system (not the VM) you can force a reprovision: 

```
vagrant destroy -f && vagrant up
```

This will delete everything -- including your data stored in Riak -- and build from source.

## Contributing
